# quizApp3

Final version of James Q Quick's QuizApp video series.

Includes some new (to me) concepts, such as using fetch to pull questions from an online source and using the .map() method to create the highScores array.

Also includes some simple animations (progress bar, loader wheel) that will probably be revisited.

Great learning exercise.

I used sessionStorage instead of localStorage as a preference. That way I start with a new top 5 everytime I open the app.
